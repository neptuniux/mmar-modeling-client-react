/**
 * The scene tree: SceneTypes at the top level, their SceneInstances underneath, and a
 * double-click to open one in a tab.
 *
 * CONTEXT MENUS carry their target with them — the node under the cursor is passed to
 * the dialog as its payload, so nothing has to be re-selected inside it:
 *   SceneType      Create (that type preselected)
 *   SceneInstance  Open / Create (its parent type preselected) / Duplicate / Rename /
 *                  Share / Delete, each prefilled with that scene
 *   empty space    Create with nothing preselected
 * Because the scene is always known, the Duplicate, Delete and Share dialogs have no
 * scene picker, and so never call `loadAllSceneInstances()` — which hydrates every
 * scene in the database just to fill a dropdown.
 *
 * LAZY LOADING: the tree is built to the SceneType level on mount; each type's
 * SceneInstances are fetched the first time its arrow is expanded. That matters because
 * the server hydrates each scene in full (classes, relations, ports, attributes, roles),
 * so an eager fetch would scale startup with the whole database rather than with the
 * scene being opened. The one consumer that genuinely needs every scene — the reference
 * dialog, since a reference may point into a scene the user never expanded — calls
 * `loadAllSceneInstances()` behind its own spinner.
 *
 * The canonical arrays live on `globalObject.sceneTypes` / `globalObject.sceneTree`;
 * this component mirrors them into local state to render.

 * after, so remote presence starts drawing as soon as peers publish it.
 *
 * `tabIndex` defaults to the tab just opened, which is the open-scene case. The
 * `sceneAccessGranted` handler passes an explicit index instead, so a tab that is
 * ALREADY open can be promoted to shared the moment it crosses the two-user threshold,
 * without a reload; the early `isShared` return makes that idempotent.
 *
 * Failures are non-fatal: a user without delete access cannot read the access list, and
