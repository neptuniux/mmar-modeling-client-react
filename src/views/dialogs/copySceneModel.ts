/**
 * The uuid-rewriting deep copy behind the "Duplicate SceneInstance" dialog, kept apart
 * from the component so the rewriting is unit-testable without rendering a dialog.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS: the SceneInstance is serialised to JSON once, and every uuid in the
 * graph is then replaced by a fresh v4 uuid with a global string replace over that
 * text. Working on the text rather than walking and assigning is what keeps the copy
 * internally consistent for free — a uuid that appears both as an identity
 * (`class_instance.uuid`) and as a cross-reference
 * (`role_instance.uuid_has_reference_class_instance`, `assigned_uuid_class_instance`, …)
 * is rewritten at BOTH sites in the same pass. That is why this is not a structured walk.
 *
 * Two details worth keeping:
 *
 * 1. Revival goes through gds's own `SceneInstance.fromJS`, never the app's
 *    `plainToInstance`. The app and gds each bundle their own class-transformer, and
 *    gds's `@Type` metadata lives only in gds's copy, so the app's `plainToInstance`
 *    shallow-revives: nested class instances would stay plain objects and every
 *    downstream `instanceof ClassInstance` check would fail.
 *
 * 2. `table_attributes` are rewritten RECURSIVELY, because a table column's own
 *    attribute can itself be a table (the demo metamodel's Robotic system → Joint does
 *    exactly this). Descending only one level would leave the copy holding the
 *    ORIGINAL's uuids down there, so both scenes would claim the same attribute-instance
 *    uuid and their saves would collide on the same database row.
