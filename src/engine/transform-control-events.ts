/**
 * Reacts to the transform gizmo: `onTransformControlsPropertyChange` on every frame of
 * a drag, `onTransformControlsMouseUp` once the drag ends. `sceneInitiator` registers
 * both against the TransformControls "change" / "mouseUp" events.
 *
 * Moving or rotating a LABEL (a child mesh, not the instance mesh itself) writes the
 * new pose into the label's custom variables — on the three.js object and on the gds
 * instance — and marks them `user_locked`, so a later vizRep re-run does not snap a
 * hand-placed label back to its computed position.
 *
 * Those variables are addressed BY POSITION (`Object.keys(...)[0..6]`), which is
 * load-bearing: `graphic-context.graphic_text` writes the three pos_name_x/y/z keys
 * first and rx/ry/rz/rw last, so indices 0-2 are the position variables and 3-6 the
 * rotation ones.

/**
 * Counter-scale every descendant of `object` that does not carry its own explicit
 * scale, so anything attached as a plain child keeps a constant absolute size when
 * `object` itself is resized — a child with its own persisted
 * `custom_variables.scale` is left alone instead.
 *
 * Labels (`userData.isLabel`, set by `graphic-context.graphic_text`) are the
 * exception: they are pinned to identity so they inherit the parent's scale and
 * grow/shrink WITH the object.
 *
 * Shared by every UI that can resize a mesh (the scale gizmo here, and the Position
 * panel's numeric Scale field) so they all leave the object in the same state that
 * `graphic-context.setScale` recreates when the scene is reloaded.
 *
 * A no-op when `object` is not a real three.js Object3D (e.g. a plain test double)
 * rather than assuming `userData` / `traverse` exist.
